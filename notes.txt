TODO:
trigger table/group
- each object stores 2 arrays of light keys 
   - triggerers
   - triggerees
- distinction between triggered and activated?
- Activate() calls Trigger() on triggerees of light
- how to manage triggerer/triggerees of lights?
   - mouse?
   - manually type light names into text field? (how to remove?)
   - dropdown box? (for real???)
   - mouse is probably the best option here
      - checkbox under lightgui to enable
      - left click to add
      - right click to remove
      - prototype wouild be something like AddTrigger(trigger, triggeree)
         - function will add triggerer into triggeree's array
         - same thing for remove
