#0 LMS new UI revamp <- you may start working on this with a suitable front-end web-app 
   language/architecture you are comfortable with (I recommend react)

You may ask Viola for any missing resources that you may need in the development

#1 Edit light page 

#2 Configuration feature – individual feature configure 

#3 Grouping feature – to group the selected lights 

#4 OTA feature – update light’s firmware (progress, firmware check, etc.) 

 
Up to your design, these could be multiple pages or a single web page.

You may find some references and come up with some preliminary front-end UI simulation for 
the above, as firmware/backend are not available yet.

Thereafter, we may find Viola (our design manager) for UI/UX improvements.

TODO
get eventlisteners working with react
